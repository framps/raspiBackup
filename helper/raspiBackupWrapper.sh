# 	Sample script to wrap raspiBackup.sh in order to start any postprocessing programs like pishrink or raspiBackupRestore2Image
#
# 	Visit http://www.linux-tips-and-tricks.de/raspiBackup for details about raspiBackup
#
#	NOTE: This is sample code how to extend functionality of raspiBackup and is provided as is with no support.
